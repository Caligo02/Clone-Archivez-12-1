Howdy!!!
This is a solo project i worked through in my final year at the University of Mississippi where I created a web application wihtout using a traditional front or back end where I could display my 3d avatar work for VR
The only things I utelized were vscode tradtional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For the Login process I used firebase
The main thing I learned was how to implement the models themselves without using traditional front and back end work but also taking into account that if I ever wanted to go large or expand with this project after the fact, then I would have to then utelize the front and back end that it lacks
